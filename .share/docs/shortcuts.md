# Window Management
Note:
where i say an arrow key, i also mean the corresponding hjkl key.


## Window focus
`super+h / left arrow` - Change focus left

`super+l / right arrow` - Change focus right

`super+k / up arrow` - Change focus up

`super+j / down arrow` - Change focus down

## Moving windows
`super+shift+left` - Move selected window to the left

`super+shift+right` - Move selected window to the right

`super+shift+up` - Move selected window to the up

`super+shift+down` - Move selected window to the down

## Workspaces
Substitute \<num\> with the number of the workspace you want to move it to.

`super+<num>` - Move view to workspace \<num\>

`super+shift+<num>` - Move selected window to workspace \<num\>

## Layout stuff
### Splits
This controls how the window will be split when a new window is created.
Is sometimes useful, but most of the time I find it easier to just fiddle about till the windows appear how I want them to.

`super+b` - Splits the window horizontally

`super+v` - Splits the window vertically

`super+e` - Toggles between the two (use this one probs)

### Collections (tabs)
Tabs are very useful.
Allows you to collect your windows into tabs like you have in a browser.
Useful when you need multiple things accesable and viewable near each other, but not at the exact same time.
For example, some code documentation open, then in that same tab collection a web browser for googling things, and then to the side of that you have your editor.

Stacking layout is also a thing, but I haven't ever used it yet.

`super+s` - Stacking

`super+w` - Tabbed

## Misc


`super+f` - Make window fullscreen

`super+backslash` - Make window float above other windows

---

I actually only just found about this.
I am a bit unsure about it, but it seems to allow you to select multiple windows at once, which is useful.
However there is no bind atm to deselect both windows and go to one without using a mouse so id stay away.
`super+a` - Focus the parent window.

---

The scratch pad is like another workspace, except all the windows in it are set to float, and it can be pulled up and layered on top of other workspaces.

`super+shift+minus` - Move selected window to scratchpad.

`super+minus` - Show window in scratchpad. If there are multiple, it cycles through them.

### Resize

You can enter a mode where you can resize windows.
The controls kinda suck though so i would reccoment `super+right-mouse-button` and draging instead.

`super+r` - to enter resize mode

`super+movement-keys` - to change the size

`escape` - to exit resize mode.

Whole bunch of options for what type of screenshot you want to take.
(print means printscreen button)

`super+Print` - A screenshot with a rectangular selection.
