'''
This program cycles through a list of keyboard brighness percentage values.
Created for if you only have a single brighness key on your keyboard

Change the states var if you want a differnt set of values You can change the
cycle order by chaging the sort_order var to be Â±1

Based on an example script from the archwiki available here
[[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Keyboard_backlight]]

# How it works
Gets the keyboard backlight as an object.  Then goes through the list of states
to find the closest value to account for rounding the final percentage to an
int.

Then if the new value is going to wrap around, it then goes to the other side
of the array depending on the sort order variable

Then it converts the new percentage from the states array to an interger and
sets the brightness to that. Also logs a bunch of stuff.
